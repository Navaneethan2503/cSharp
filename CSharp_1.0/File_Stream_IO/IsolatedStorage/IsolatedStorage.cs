/**
Isolated Storage:
-----------------
Isolated Storage in C# is a data storage mechanism that provides a virtual file system isolated by user, assembly, or application. It‚Äôs especially useful for storing user-specific data like settings, logs, or temporary files in a secure and sandboxed environment.

üîê Why Use Isolated Storage?
Security: Keeps data isolated from other applications.
Portability: Works across different environments without hardcoding paths.
User Scope: Data can be scoped per user, per application, or per assembly.
No Admin Rights Needed: Apps can store data without writing to protected system folders.

üìÅ Where Is It Stored?
The actual location depends on the OS and the scope, but it's typically under:

C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\IsolatedStorage\

üõ†Ô∏è Key Classes in System.IO.IsolatedStorage
Class	Purpose
IsolatedStorageFile	Represents the isolated storage area
IsolatedStorageFileStream	Used to read/write files in isolated storage

üß† Scoping Options
GetUserStoreForAssembly() ‚Äì Isolated by user and assembly.
GetUserStoreForDomain() ‚Äì Isolated by user and application domain.
GetMachineStoreForAssembly() ‚Äì Isolated by machine and assembly (less common).

üß∞ Why Use It?
‚úÖ Security: Data is sandboxed per user and per application.
‚úÖ No Need for File Paths: You don‚Äôt need to worry about where to store files on disk.
‚úÖ Easy to Use: It abstracts away the complexity of file system access.
‚úÖ Cross-Platform: Works across different Windows versions consistently.


üß™ How It Works
Create a store: You request an isolated storage space.
Create files/folders: You can create files and directories inside this space.
Read/Write data: Use standard file I/O operations to read/write data.
Close the store: Always close the store when done.

üì¶ Types of Isolated Storage
Per User, Per Assembly: Most common. Isolated by user and application.
Per User, Per Domain: Isolated by user and application domain.
Roaming Profiles: Can be used with domain accounts to sync across devices.


‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Keep in Mind
Not suitable for large data storage.
Not recommended for new development in .NET Core or .NET 5+ (use Environment.GetFolderPath() or ApplicationData instead).
Limited to desktop applications (not supported in ASP.NET Core).

üîπ 1. User + Assembly Isolation
Most common type.
Data is isolated by user and by the application (assembly).
Each user has a separate storage area for each application.
Use case: Storing user preferences or settings for a specific app.

üîπ 2. User + Domain Isolation
Isolated by user and application domain.
Useful when multiple applications share the same assembly but run in different domains.
Less commonly used in modern apps.

üîπ 3. Machine + Assembly Isolation
Data is shared across all users on the machine but isolated by assembly.
Useful for storing application-wide settings that are not user-specific.
Requires elevated permissions.

üîπ 4. Machine + Domain Isolation
Data is shared across all users and isolated by domain.
Rarely used and also requires elevated permissions.
