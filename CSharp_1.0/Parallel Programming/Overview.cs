Parallel programming:
---------------------
Many personal computers and workstations have multiple CPU cores that enable multiple threads to be executed simultaneously. To take advantage of the hardware, you can parallelize your code to distribute work across multiple processors.

In the past, parallelization required low-level manipulation of threads and locks. Visual Studio and .NET enhance support for parallel programming by providing a runtime, class library types, and diagnostic tools. These features, which were introduced in .NET Framework 4, simplify parallel development. You can write efficient, fine-grained, and scalable parallel code in a natural idiom without having to work directly with threads or the thread pool.

Parallel programming in C# allows you to execute multiple computations simultaneously, which can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your applications. Here are some key aspects:

1. Task Parallel Library (TPL)
The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is a set of public types and APIs in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace. It simplifies the process of adding parallelism and concurrency to applications. TPL includes:

Parallel class: Provides parallel versions of For and ForEach loops.
Task class: Represents an asynchronous operation and is the preferred way to express asynchronous operations in C#.
2. Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)
PLINQ is a parallel implementation of LINQ to Objects. It can significantly improve performance by utilizing multiple processors. PLINQ queries can be written just like regular LINQ queries but are executed in parallel.

3. Data Structures for Parallel Programming
C# provides several thread-safe collection classes and lightweight synchronization types to help manage data in a parallel environment. These include:

Concurrent collections: Such as ConcurrentDictionary, ConcurrentQueue, etc.
Synchronization primitives: Such as SemaphoreSlim, Mutex, etc.
4. Parallel Diagnostic Tools
Visual Studio offers several tools to help diagnose and debug parallel applications, including:

Tasks and Parallel Stacks windows: For viewing tasks and their relationships.
Concurrency Visualizer: For analyzing the behavior of parallel applications.
5. Custom Partitioners
Partitioners divide the data source into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. You can configure default partitioners or create custom ones to optimize performance.

6. Lambda Expressions in PLINQ and TPL
Lambda expressions are used extensively in PLINQ and TPL to define the operations to be performed in parallel. They provide a concise way to represent anonymous methods.
