/**
the StringBuilder class is part of the System.Text namespace and is used for manipulating strings in a more efficient way than using regular string concatenation, especially when dealing with large or frequently modified strings.

Why Use StringBuilder?
Strings in C# are immutable, meaning every time you modify a string, a new object is created in memory. This can lead to performance issues when performing many operations. StringBuilder solves this by using a mutable string buffer.

ðŸ”¸ Key Features
Efficient memory usage for repeated string modifications.
Dynamic resizing of the internal buffer.
Thread-unsafe by default, but can be made thread-safe.

The String object is immutable. Every time you use one of the methods in the System.String class, you create a new string object in memory, which requires a new allocation of space for that new object. In situations where you need to perform repeated modifications to a string, the overhead associated with creating a new String object can be costly.
The System.Text.StringBuilder class can be used when you want to modify a string without creating a new object. For example, using the StringBuilder class can boost performance when concatenating many strings together in a loop.


Importing the System.Text Namespace:
------------------------------------
The StringBuilder class is found in the System.Text namespace. To avoid having to provide a fully qualified type name in your code, you can import the System.Text namespace:

Instantiating a StringBuilder Object:
-------------------------------------
You can create a new instance of the StringBuilder class by initializing your variable with one of the overloaded constructor methods, 

StringBuilder Class
-------------------
Represents a mutable string of characters. This class cannot be inherited.

    public sealed class StringBuilder : System.Runtime.Serialization.ISerializable

Constructors:
-------------
StringBuilder()	- Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class.
    public StringBuilder();

StringBuilder(Int32, Int32)	- Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class that starts with a specified capacity and can grow to a specified maximum.
    public StringBuilder(int capacity, int maxCapacity);
        Remark:
        --------
        If capacity is zero, the implementation-specific default capacity is used.
        The maxCapacity property defines the maximum number of characters that the current instance can hold. Its value is assigned to the MaxCapacity property. If the number of characters to be stored in the current instance exceeds this maxCapacity value, the StringBuilder object does not allocate additional memory, but instead throws an exception.

StringBuilder(Int32) - Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class using the specified capacity.
    public StringBuilder(int capacity);

StringBuilder(String, Int32, Int32, Int32)	- Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class from the specified substring and capacity.
    public StringBuilder(string? value, int startIndex, int length, int capacity);

StringBuilder(String, Int32) - Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class using the specified string and capacity.
    public StringBuilder(string? value, int capacity);
    
StringBuilder(String)	- Initializes a new instance of the StringBuilder class using the specified string.
    public StringBuilder(string? value);


Properties:
-------------
Capacity- Gets or sets the maximum number of characters that can be contained in the memory allocated by the current instance.
Chars[Int32]	- Gets or sets the character at the specified character position in this instance.
    public char this[int index] { get; set; }
    Using character-based indexing with the Chars[] property can be extremely slow under the following conditions:
    The StringBuilder instance is large (for example, it consists of several tens of thousands of characters).
    The StringBuilder is "chunky." That is, repeated calls to methods such as StringBuilder.Append have automatically expanded the object's StringBuilder.Capacity property and allocated new chunks of memory to it.
    Performance is severely impacted because each character access walks the entire linked list of chunks to find the correct buffer to index into.
    Even for a large "chunky" StringBuilder object, using the Chars[] property for index-based access to one or a small number of characters has a negligible performance impact; typically, it is an O(n) operation. The significant performance impact occurs when iterating the characters in the StringBuilder object, which is an O(n^2) operation.

Length	- Gets or sets the length of the current StringBuilder object.
MaxCapacity	- Gets the maximum capacity of this i
